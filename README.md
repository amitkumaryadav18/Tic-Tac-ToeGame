# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

# Amazing Project for fresher 

A Tic-Tac-Toe game made only using JavaScript (i.e. By Injecting from JS to DOM).
Tic - Tac - Toe Game 
The game is based on 
Tic-tac-toe (or) noughts and crosses (or) Xs and Os is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking
the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid.
The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.


The objective of this was to practice DOM manupilution which programmers generally avoid.
The code is in 'venilla' JavaScript.
